# discord-elo-bot
a bot that can take teams and sort them by MMR using discord.py

##the bot is **half baked**, but it does work to create teams and give them mmr, but the rest of the bot is broken

the commands are
- create_team: which propts users to give the team a name, make a person a captain, and to add players 
- submit_scores: which prompts the users to enter the team names and team scores, and gives them the respecitve mmr 
- register_sub: this is supposed to rigster a player into the database as a sub and give the sub role, idk if it works because it doesnt give the role, but it look like its adding users into the player base just fine
